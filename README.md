# Simple Cloud Media Server

Use this for sharing files with video editors and other staff.

## TO DO

* Implement tagging and timecodes for media asset files.

For example, a video file could have tags like:
takoyaki, walking, osaka, japan, eating, food closeup, ryan kopf

And maybe even automatic transcriptions.

* Implement clipmaking feature. Have a clip model defining a source, start/end, name, description
