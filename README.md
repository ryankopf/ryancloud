# Simple Cloud Media Server

Use this for sharing files with video editors and other staff.

* Make clips from your videos.
* Tag clips and videos with keywords, names, descriptions.

For example, a video file could have tags like:
takoyaki, walking, osaka, japan, eating, food closeup, ryan kopf

## TO DO

* Automatic video transcriptions.
* Add "points of interest" at time points. IE if I look at something, and we want clips of that later. IE, look at a karaoke store? Well then I can search "karaoke store".
